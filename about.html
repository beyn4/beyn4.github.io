		<div class="intro">Education</div>
		<p>I am an alumna of Duke University with a degree in biology and global health and a minor in computational biology & bioinformatics. At Duke, I was a <a href="https://today.duke.edu/2019/08/university-scholars-represent-range-personal-intellectual-backgrounds">University Scholar</a>, <a href="https://healthpolicy.duke.edu/people/nadia-bey-babs-23">Margolis Scholar</a> and <a href="https://questbridge.org">QuestBridge Scholar</a>. I also served on the executive board of the Student Collaborative on Health Policy. I graduated with distinction with a thesis titled <a href="https://dukespace.lib.duke.edu/dspace/handle/10161/27056"><i>Telemedicine utilization by North Carolina farmworkers: a content analysis</i></a> and am now pursuing an MPH in health policy at George Washington University.</p>
		<div class="intro">Research</div>
		<p>At GW, I research policies and practices for diversifying the health workforce and improving health outcomes for diverse communities with the <a href="https://socialmission.org/team-member/nadia-bey/">Social Mission Alliance</a>. At Duke, I was a research assistant in Dr. Ruth Day’s Medical Cognition Lab, a researcher with Revaluing Care in the Global Economy, a Duke-Margolis health policy intern, and a data intern with Duke Health’s Office of Community Health. To learn more about each of these projects, see my <a href="/research.html">research page.</a>
		<div class="intro">Teaching</div>
		<p>At Duke, I taught the house course “Durham Middle School Outreach” in the 2020-2021 and 2021-2022 academic years. Undergraduates who teach house courses go through an application process in which they submit resumes and course syllabi. The course covered pedagogy, sociology, and local history and involved a service component with Durham Public Schools. As course instructor I gave presentations, designed activities, and led group discussions.</p>
		<div class="intro">Journalism</div>
		<p>I was a staff writer for The Academic, a publication on student life, and later joined Affinity Magazine, writing about pop culture and current events. In 2019 I was promoted to assistant culture editor and eventually books editor. As books editor, I reviewed middle grade through adult books and facilitated the magazine’s relationship with publishers including SparkPoint, Granity Studios, and HarperCollins. My reviews were highlighted on Amazon and social media.</p>
		<p><center><img src="affinitylegacyquote.png" width="400px"/></center></p>
		<p>I worked at The Chronicle, Duke’s student newspaper, from matriculation to graduation. In that time, I served as managing editor and digital strategy director, received recognition from the <a href="https://ncopengov.com/duke-chronicle-journalists-win-frank-barrows-award-for-series-use-of-force-by-duke-university-police/">North Carolina Open Government Coalition</a> and <a href="https://studentpress.org/acp/2022-best-use-of-social-media"/>Associated Collegiate Press</a>, used data to support my reporting, advocated for improved web accessibility, and wrote over 100 articles. I was also co-president of Duke's chapter of <a href="https://hercampus.com/school/duke">Her Campus</a>.</p>
		<p>In summer 2022, I interned on the North Carolina investigations desk for McClatchy News, covering health and policy for The Charlotte Observer and attending IRE22. The following year, I was a data reporting intern with Chalkbeat, where I analyzed data in spreadsheets and used HTML and CSS to develop graphics. I was a <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/propublica-emerging-reporters-2022">2022-23 ProPublica Emerging Reporter fellow</a> and a 2021 recipient of the organization's <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/meet-propublicas-2021-diversity-scholarship-recipients">Diversity Scholarship</a>. My involvement in these programs allowed me to attend NICAR21 and NICAR23 and receive training from ProPublica journalists.</p>
		<p>As a freelancer, I write about science and health. To read my work, see my <a href=/writing.html>writing page.</a></p>
